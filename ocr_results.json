I'd like to share my own\n\nviews, since I've had some experience with the issue.\n\nA small but vocal group of employees have pressured me to\neither ban smoking or to segregate smokers and nonsmokers.\nWhen they first approached me I considered the situation but,\n\nfor several reasons, decided against any restrictions.\n\nFirst, implementing smoking policies would have required\nthat I take action against good employees who have worked\n\nfor me for quite some time. Second, to implement a smoking\npolicy would have disrupted my company's work process, since,\nas in many offices, employees with similar skills and responsi-\n\nbilities work together.\n\nFurthermore, once I took a hard look at the situation, I dis-\ncovered that the vast majority of my employees were neither\n\naware of nor particularly interested in the problem.\n\nI have not read any of Weis' articles to which Solmon referred\nnor have I considered the economic aspect of the argument on\nwhich Solmon's article was based. But common sense suggcsts\nthat rearranging people, changing policies, implementing re-\n\nstrictions, and disrupting my workforce won't save me moncy.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTIOK 0027645",

Keritsis\n\nPM CASE 641 DIVISION III\n\nCraig in U.S. Patent 2,583,548 teaches the treatment of cellulosic pulp\ncontaining 1% to 6% of fibers with an excessive amount (10%) of a calcium\nchloride solution which gives a salt to fiber dry weight ratio from 1.6/7\nto 10; causing the pulp containing the calcium chloride to a prolonged\nmechanical treatment, and then adding a soluble salt such as sodium\ncarbonate to react with the calcium chloride to form a precipitated\ncalcium compound pigment.\n\nOur case (Serial No. 519,619) differs from that of Craig in that the\ncellulosic pulp is caused to swell and hydrate by chemical means by react-\ning the cellulosic pulp with the ammonium and/or alkali metal hydroxides\nwhich in addition force the polyvalent metal ions to be fixed in the\ncellulosic matrix either as a water insoluble precipitate or as a \u201csalt\u201d\nof the cellulosic matrix. Both of these mechanisms of precipitating or\nfixing metalic ions uniformly in the cellulosic matrix are probably\nresponsible for altering the combustion of the cellulosic substrate and\nfor improving the subjective character of smoke. The required amounts\nof precipitated or fixed metal ions needed to achieve this effect is\nsignificantly lower than that practiced by Craig for a different purpose\n(in our case the ratio of salt to cellulosic material is less than 0.4).\n\nBriskin, et. al., (U.S. Patent 3,640,285) deals with the treatment of\ncigarette paper containing calcium or magnesium or strontium or barium\noxalate, pivalate, tannate. This paper could be produced by treating an\nexisting cigarette paper containing calcium carbonate with oxalic acid or\npivalis or tannic, or by adding the desired salt to the cellulosic pulp\nused in the original formation of the paper web (see column 2 lines 65-69).\n\nIn this case, Briskin teaches the selection of one salt over another for\n\na cigarette paper and his method of treatment in no way teaches or makes\nobvious the treatment of cellulosic material with hydroxides of ammonium\nand/or alkalies to uniformly fix a polyvalent metal cation to the celluto-\nsic matrix. In column 2 lines 37-38 \u201cThe oxalic acid solution operates to\nconvert calcium carbonate to insoluble calcium oxalate.\" We do not see any\nrelation in this statement to those of ours since Briskin converts one\ninsoluble salt, CaC03, to another insoluble salt, calcium oxalate, and\naccording to his earlier statement, column 2 lines 65-69 it does not make a\ndifference whether the oxalate is added to the paper at the pulping section\nin place of calcium carbonate or is formed by treating the paper containing\nthe carbonate with oxalic acid. As a result our invention is in'no way\n\nsimilar or obvious from the Briskin teachings. Also, it is claimed in Claim\n\n1 that one of the anions that could be used to form the calcium salt is\n\"\u201cYactic acid\" which forms calcium lactate with a very good solubility in\nwater!\n\n\u00a3SSU8S8202",

The cigarettes\nare mild-tasting and do not appear to produce fiery particles.\n\nHand-made cigarettes were fabricated having a carbon\ncore derived from a laterally crimped cellulosic non-woven\nsheet.

Using cellulose\nas a model, it has been discovered that carboxyl groups\nproduced by chemical oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups\nundergo rapid decarboxylation at low pyrolysis temperature\n(240\u00b0C). It is unlikely that the resultant product can\nform levoglucosan, the primary initial degradation product\nof cellulose. This may give some insight into an explanation\nas to why oxidized cellulose produces milder smoker than\nuntreated cellulose. Other carboxyl groups, such as those\nproduced by air oxidation, are more resistant to decarboxyla-\ntion.

To aid Justice Warren: and\nhis colleagues, we'd like to quote\nat some length from a letter by\n/ the well-known novelist Taylor\nie Nuss ies \u2018tenis \u00ab a Wanderer, a na-\n\n, tional Catholic: weekly published:\nTaylor Caldwell = at St. Paul, Minn.\n\nCalled. most kindly to: our attention by. New York's\nConservative Party, the letter was printed in-The Wan-\nderer's Oct. $1,, 1963, issue, weeka before the President\nwas murdered:\n\nas. Treceive hundreds of letters a year from all over\nthe world, even from behind the Iron Curtain, from fans :of\nmine. Lately theiletters are full of disquiet, a sense of \u2018dis-.\naster near\u2018at hand... human instinct is stirring in fear-\neverywhere...\n\nhe enemies of freedom and! God are: everywhere in\n\nevery country of the West. It is possible that Mr. Kennedy\n\nis:in personal jeopardy from them... Indeed, it.ig very:\n\nprobable. Presidents have been murdered before in our his-\n\n~..fory,.anc in: less dreadful times. Among. our enemies there:\nare many madmen.\n\nIT receive quite a number of pro-Communist and \u201clibera!'\"'\nperiodicals; and! some are quite inflammatory... seme of\nour big: monthly magazines, for instance\u2014are wrathful.\nagainst our President,\n\nIt: seems that. they had expected! him to overthrow. the:\nConstitution and set up a sort of crypto-Communist dictator-\nship. (They call it \u201cprogress.\u201d) Hae:has disappointed 'them,,\nand there is.no: canard! too mean for them to print and no\nsneer too ugly for. some of their pages. His parents, his\nwife, his. children, his brothers and: sisters, are held up to\nridicule in a lot of the \u201cliberal\u201d and pro-Communist press.\n.-.. As that part of our: national press is influenced from\nMoscow itis easy to see the temper \u2018of many of them, And\ntha: temper ca easily inflame madmen...\n\nThe: mere vhought of Mr. Kennedy being assassinated\nshould make alliof us shudder...\n\nThen there are the \u201cagents provocateur\u201d who would just\nlove such an \u201cincident.\u201d I know, I read some of their. litera~\nture. Iti would delight them\u2014and serve their evil purpose\u2014\nif harm icame'to: Mr. Kennedy, I have already. sent a.sample\nto the Department of Justice; it actually euggestsd that our\nPresident be lynched!\n\nIt is to be hoped that the Caldwell letter, among other\nfactors, will impel the: Warren commission to look: deeply\ninto the: Communist aspect of the assassination, and to re-\nsist the attempts of such persons.as Sen. J. W.. Fulbright\n(D-Ark:) to shift the blame to the so-called! radical right\nhate groups. Whatever else Oswald was, he didn\u2019t belong:\nto the John: Birch: Society\u2014a fact which. should carry. its\nproper. weight with the Warren commission.\n\nAND NOW, ABOUT CUBA\n\nThe United Nations Security Council, with all 11 mem\nber nations fearlessly voting. Aye; adopts a resolution call-\ninig for a worldwide arms.embargo. against: South. Africa\nbecause of its: apartheid\u2014discrimination against Negroes.\n\nWe'll' second the: resolution: enthusiastically.. Apar-\ntheid in some of: its aspects. would shock. many'a diehard\n\n: . U.S. segregationist and white supremacist.\nApartheid i. And now, how: about U..S: UN Am-\nCastroism: \u00bbassador Adlai Stevenson introducing a\n\n, similar resolution calling for a worldwide\narms embargo against Castro-Khrushchev Cuba?\u2019\n\nCastro outdoes South Africa in discriminating against\nCubans ;and he.is trying to export! his Communism to main-\nland!

Nicotine from this smoke makes its way to\nthe fetus, and medical researchers have document-\ned several damaging consequences. Nicotine expo-\nsure has been linked to a higher rate of spontaneous\nabortions, lower birth weights and a higher rate of\nattention deficit disorder.\n\nFurthermore, a study published this month\nfound a substantial increase in Sudden Infant Death\nSyndrome (commonly known as \u201ccrib death\u201d)\namong infants exposed to smoke before birth.\n\nSIDS kills more than 5,000 babies per year in the\nUnited States; more babies between the age of 1\nmonth and 1 year die of SIDS than from any other\ncause. The causes of crib death have long been\nmystetious \u2014 and in fact, part of the definition of\nSIDS is that the death is unexplained. But while the\n\n\u201cunknown causes of SIDS aren\u2019t likely to be simple,\ncigarette smoke seems to be a factor. \u2014\n\nSmoking by mothers, fathers or other people in\nthe same room with a baby greatly increases the crib\ndeath risk, researchers from the University of Cali-\nfornia, San Diego, reported last month in the Jour-\nnal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\u201cThe greater the total number of cigarettes the\ninfant was passively exposed to after birth from all\nadults, the higher the risk of SIDS,\u201d wrote Hillary\nSandra Klonoff-Cohen and colleagues.\n\nFurthermore, smoke raises the risk of SIDS even\nwhen the exposure comes before birth. When fa-\nthers smoked in the presence of a nonsmoking\nmother during pregnancy, for example, the risk of\ninfant crib death more than tripled. If the mother\nsmoked during pregnancy, the risk was even great-\ner, the researchers found.\n\nOf course, such research represents only an in-\ndictment of cigarette smoke as a baby killer and not\nyet a conviction, for a correlation is not proof of a\ncause-and-effect relationship. Still, other research\nhas begun to show evidence of how nicotine might\ndo direct damage to the developing fetal brain.\n\nIn a recent issue of the journal Developmental\n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nThedtaltas orning Nang\n\ndeath suggests\n\n \n\nBrain Research, Stanford University scientists fe: |.\nported that prenatal nicotine exposure can\u2019altels\nactivity in the part of the brain responstbje for\nmaintaining the biological clock. eeee\n\nBiological clocks are the pacemakers of life7peaui-s\nlating various. bodily functions including slebp7oy-~ .\ncles and body temperature. In mammals the biolog#:-\ncal clock is under the control of a small clunip.of:\nbrain cells called the suprachiasmatic nucleus\u2019. \u201csg\n\nStudying laboratory rats, the Stanford restateli-:\ners injected mothers-to-b\u00e9 with nicotine and\u2019 then.\nexamined resulting changes in brain process\u00e9s in\u2018\nboth the mother and fetuses. (Comparisons; were~\nmade to a group of rats injected with saling s\u00e9ld~.\ntion.) Nicotine caused several changes in brain\u2019ac-:\ntivity, and for the most part the changes wer\u00e9 the\u201d\nsame in mother rat and babies-to-be. \u2018\n\nIn the last few days before birth, however,. nico-\ntine induced a change in the fetuses\u2019 suprachiasma-\ntic nuclei, though not in the mothers\u2019. The change\nwas the switching into sction of a particular gene\nknown as c-fos. Among other things, c-fos plays an\nimportant role in the regulation of circadian.\nrhythms \u2014 the daily rhythms of the biological\u2019 -\nclock. So by altering c-fos activity, nicotine likely\ngave the fetal rats an artificial form of jety Jag, .|-\n\n \n\n8\n\n9D\n\n \n\nWw\n\n \n\nthrowing the circadian rhythm of mothers and;ba- f\n\nbies out of sync.\n\n\u201cIf nicotinic ... stimulation in the fetus hie. an\neffect on the biological clock, there could be poten-..\ntially damaging effects,\u201d\"Thomas Kilduff and col:\nleagues wrote. Interference with circadian rhythms'-\nmight throw off the normal process of mother-child\u2019.\nbonding, for example.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that the increased incidence of\u201d\nSudden Infant Death Syndrome. and. Attention | Defi-\ncit Disorders in the offspring of maternal smokers .\nmay be related to this very mechanism,\u201d the Stan-..\nford scientists speculated.\n\nIt may be no coincidence, the researchers\u201d Suge\u201d\ngest, that the peak period of SIDS desths \u2014 in infants\n2 to 4 months old \u2014 corresponds to a time when the .\nbabies\u2019 circadian rhythm cycles are being eataby.\nlished.\n\nMore research is needed to pin down the possible\naks between smoke, circadian rhythms and\u2019 SIDS.\nBut results so far clearly suggest that the dangers of\u2019\nsecondhand smoke may go far beyond a small Statis-'\ntical increase in the Hkelihood of lung cancer.\n\nTn the chemistry of the developing brain, tiny\namounts of certain substances can have serious.\neffects that last a lifetime, such as making\u2019 that:\nlifetime very, very short. .\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfect rare",

Meanwhile, filter folks are\nturning loose a clamor of claims in\ncurrent promotion. Riggio Tobacco,\nwhich the king-size Regent, came\nout with a filter-tip Repent last week\nand claims it is the \u201conly one to give\nyou filtered smoke but unfiltered flavor.\u201d\n\nDa Maurier, a recert filter entry, is\nFall poping: this appeal: \u201cStart today to\nsmoke with greater peace of mind...\nwith the world\u2019s most efficient filter.\u201d\nP. Lorillard\u2019s Kent, now also king-size,\nsays its filter \u201ctakes out more nicotine\nand tars than any other filter cigarette.\u201d\nLiggett & Myers continues to thunder\nclaims for its L&M Filter and repor.s\nsales are soaring. Brown & William.\nson is on a rampage of TV spots for\nits Viceroy; other Alters are shrilling\nthaw safeguards to unciy smokers.\nAnt American \u2018lohaees. onl major\n\ncompany without a filter offering, al-\nmost certanly will have one soon.\n\nNone of this advertising, except\nRegent's, broke after release of Amer-\n{ean Cancer Society\u2019s study on effects\nof smoking. But filter makers won't be\nlong in g & cue from the study,\njudging from du Maurier\u2019s repeated\nadvice on how to smoke \u201cwith greater\npeace of mind.\u201d Impact of ACS\u2019 study,\ntoo, will put an edge on competition\nbetween filters. Already Kent, which\nhas steadily insisted its micronite filter\nis the best of any major brand, is un-\nderstood to be bristling wer du Maurier\nclaim to the \u201cniost efficient Alter.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the cigarette clan as a\nwhole is making no public predictions\non the effect of the ACS report.

Mark Curriden :\nLeqel Affaire Writer ef The Dallus Morcing News\".\n\nAn unexpectedly sharp decline\nin cigarette sales could cost the\nstate of Texas $200 million in the\nnext two years, lawyers sald Thurs\nday. .\n\nTobacco industry officials have\ninformed leadars of several states,\nincluding Texas, that consumption\nof cigarettes in the United Statea\nhas decreased 7 percent to 1D per.\ncent during the past year.\n\nThe sudden steep decline in\nsmoking, according to anti-smoking\n\n\u201cadvocates, ig the result of dramatic\n\nS0-cent price increase in cigarettes\nthat wes needed to help the tobacco\ncompanies pay for the casts of set\ntling historic multibillion-dollar\nlawsuits with the state attorneys\ngeneral during tha past two years.\n\nWhile tebacco critics trumpeted\nthe news of a reduction in smoking}.\nthe decrease in cigarette revenues\nhas a downside: Setdement pay-\nments to the states will also go\ndown. :\n\nFor Texas, which settled\u2019 ity to\n\n\u201cpacco case in January 1994 for $173\n\nbillion, the decline in consumption\n\ncould mean $50 million to 678 mit. -\n\nMon leas in payments to the state's\ntreasury {n the next five weeks. Lf\ncigarette sales continue to decrease,\nTexas would see its share of the\n\ntobacco money drop by $260 million |\n\nduring the next toro years \u2014 money\nthat has already bean budgeted by\nstate lawmakers and Gov. George\nW. Bush .\n\nBut lawyers who negotiated the\ntobacco settlements say the drop in\nconsumption was a primary goal in\nthe lawsuits. :\n\n\u201cTha lotended impact of these\nsettioments was to dive op prices\nenough that peaple would chose no!\noo aka nid Yoraper Tezas asals\ntant attarney gynoral Harry Porter,\nwho led the negotiations for Texas.\n\n\u201cTo see cigarette consumption\ndrop 90 quickly 90 goon after the\n\neaeangngaag.\n\nasttlament ts a tremendous develop-\nment,\u201d said Mr. Potter, who is now\nin private practice Lo Austin, \u2018Ifthe\nbulk of the decline {n sales is from\nteenagers, then that would be the\nbest news.\u201d Efforts to contact Texas\nAttorney General John Cornyn and\nMr. Bush were unsuccessful Thurs\nday.\n\nA spokesman for the tobacco\ncompanies said the industry is not\npropared to release its sales num-\nDerg at this time. However, lawyers\nin Texas, Mississippi, Florida and\nConnecticut \u2014 the statas that led\nthe legal fight against the industry\n\n-\u2014 sald Thorsday they have been\ninformed by tobacco offictals that\n\n| consumption has dropped 7 percent\nto 10 pereant glace the price in-\ncreases went into effect.\n\nUnder the deals signed by Missls-\nappl, Florida, Minnesota and Texas,\nwhich settled their cases first, the\ntobaceo compenies can subtract a\nfraction of thelr losses resulting\nfrom a decline in consumption\nfrom their payments to the states. If\nsales decline 10 percents, the indus\ntry can decreases its payment to the\nstate by 9.8 percent.\n\nHowever, those deductions\nwould be offset by penalties the in-\ndustry will bave to pay if the tobac-\nco companies report Increased prof-\nitg during the past year. And the\nindustry also has to increase Its pay-\nments to the states by 3 percent @\nyear or the rate of inflation, which-\never Ly higher,\n\n*Tt's a very complicated formula\ndesigned to make sure the tobacco\ncompanies are given credit for a\nreduction in their revenues but al-\nso held accountable for their ac-\n\n> tlons,\u201d Mississipp{ Attorney Gener-\nal Mike Moore said in an fnterview\n\n; dn 1997 when these provisions of\nthe deal were developed. \u201cThe bot-\ntom Hne is, I would rather lose ali\nour state money ip return for every-\none stopping smoking,\u201d sald Mr.\nMoore.\n\nThe volume reduction clause for\nFlorida, Minnesota, Mississippi and\n\nTexas goes into effect starting with,\n\nths next payments, which come to\nthe states Dec. 31. Texas, which has\nalready received more than $1.5 bil\nYon in payments from the tobacco\n\n6.8 9\u00b089 sansa 9a7baKa\n\ncompanies, is expected to receive a\n$326 million check on Dec. 31 and\npone: Sous million. check on Jan,\n\nThe industry alto reached a mas-\n\naive settlement with the orher 46\nstates last year for $206 billion,\nHowever, their volume-reduction\nclauses are not toiggered until\nApril. The states sued the lodustry\nto recover health care expenses re-\nlated to smoking. Instead of facing a\ntrial, the tobacco companies agreed\nto an out-of-court deal that calls for\ntham to pay the states about sid\nDillion a year for as long as people\ncondaue smoking.\n\nDespite warnings by Mr. Moora\nand other state attorneys general,\nmany state legislatures and gover-\nhors instituted the tobaceo pay-\nments into thelr sonual budgeys\nthis past year to pay for naw heal\ncare programs, education and bulid-\ning highways. \"Fraokly, the pru-\ndent thing to do is not to spelt\u2019\nspecific dollars until they s\u00e9e what\u2019\nthey will be,\" Laurie Loveland! \u00ab&\nlawyer who helped negotiate \u2018the\ntobacco settlement for the Northt\nDakota attorney general's olfite,\ntold The Assoclated Press, +\": +\n\n\u201cT think it's a mistake for state\u2019\nlegislatures to become addicted to\nihe tobacco money,\u201d she said: -*\n\nIn Texas, a3 in most states; only 2\u2019\nsmall portion of the tobacco setter\nment money fs actually being spent\nto fight smoking or going to other\nhealth-related progrems. ~\"- \u2018+\n\nTESSETHLOS",

Be\nPrincipal investigators in the trans-.\nplant project were Kirby S, Black and\nCharles W. Hewitt, co-directors of\nUC!\u2019s Reconstructive Microsurgery\nand Transplantation Laboratory.

In humans, the\ndrug has been used to help prevent\nrejection in kidney, bone marrow,\nheart-lung, pancreas and liver trans-\n\nplants.\n\nBlack said the UCI experiments\ndetermined that the drug could also\nhelp in composite tissue transplants.\nThe tests also focused on how much\ncyclosporine was needed and what\n\nside effects the-drug -migh'\nFinally, the researchers found that the\ntransplanted tissues could survive for\nthe duration of the animal\u2019s life.\n\nThe transplanted rat legs showed\nsigns of near-normal .muscle and\nnerve activity. But the limbs did not\nfunction completely \u2014 the rats could\nnot walk normally on the tranplanted\nlegs \u2014- because of the complexity of\nreconnecting the nerves and muscles\nrequired for such movement.\n\nThe rats used in the UCI tests\nnormally have a three-year life span.\nBlack said some of the rats that\nunderwent leg transplants lived as\nlong as 700 days after the surgery.\n\nHe said researchers were able to\n\naccomplish the transplants with rela-\ntively low dosages of cyclosporine, an\nimportant finding because the drug\ncan be toxic at high levels, The finding\nthat the transplant limbs survived\nafter discontinuing cyclosporine was\nunexpected, and the UCI scientist\nsaid additional studies are planned.\nWhile functional human limb\ntransplants are years away, Black said\nthe UCI experiments may have more\nimmediate implications in the re-\nplacement of large areas of skin,\nmuscle, blood vessels and bone\ndamages by burns, gunshot wounds\nor other injuries. He said such tissue\ngrafts could eventually replace the\nprosthetic devices used today.\n\n50288669\n\nshaven... .",

                "text": "ip /By JUDITH EGERTON\na \u2018arm Writer:\n\n  \n  \n\niS A new Louisville firm said yesterday that\n\n \n\nduces the health risks of smoking.\n\nThat announcement, however, didn\u2019t re-\nceive ao enthusiastic response from tobacco\ncompanies or health officials.\n\nL. Douglas Keeney, president and chief\nexecutive officer of C.A. Blockers Inc, in\nMeidinger Tower, said yesterday that the\nfirm has successfully produced slandard-\nsized cigarettes containing an additive that\n\n_ Heutralizes the effect of nltrosamines, which\nate carcinogens associated with lung can-\ncer.\n\nThe product, to be called N-BLOCTIN,\ncould be available to tobacco companies\nthis year, Keeney said. But first, tests will\nbe done on people who smoke the cigarettes\nwith the implanted additive. In a six-month\nfest period, bronchial biopsies and ceil\ncounts will be done on the smokers, he sald,\nto determine the product's effectiveness,\n\nKeeney sald in tests involving laboratary\nmice, N-BLOCTIN had proved to be \u201chighly\n\u201ceffective\u201d In blocking the accumulation of\nnitrosamines in the lungs.\n\nThe fab work was spearheaded by Dr.\nWilllam Waddell, a toxdpology specialist and\nchairman of the University of Loulsville De-\npartment of Pharmacology and Toxicology,\nwho for years has been researching toxie\neffects of tobacco and searching for a com-\npound to prevent the accumulation of car-\ncinogens, according {o Arthur Keeney.\nKeeney ls a former dean of the UofL\n\n \n\nThe Couri Journal fa 2\n| @f \u201c21-88 (5) se\n\n{| Pa 24\n\nit has produced a cigarette additive that re-\u201d\n\n\u00ae Cigarette additive reduces risks\nof smoking, firm says\n\nSchool of Medicine, the father of L. Douglas\nKeeney and a company shareholder.\n\nThe additive, developed by Waddell, is\ncomposed of a high molecular weight alco-\nbol. The test cigarettes with the additive\nwere developed al the University of Ken-\ntucky, Arthur Keeney sald,\n\n\u201cNitrosamines are the most abundant car-\ncinogens in tobacco smoke and are believed\nto be a significant factor in smoking-associ-\nated cancer of the lung. We belleve thar N-\nBLOCTIN will significantly reduce the ongo\ning risk of ing cancer among cigarette\nsmokers,\u201d be said.\n\nOlhers aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cWith 4,000 chemicals having been identi.\nfied in cigarettes ... you aren't going to\neliminate the health risks of cigarette smok-\njog,\u201d said Dr. Ron Davis, with the US. Of-\n\nfice of Smoking and Health. But, he said,\n\nyou could lower the health risk by blocking -\n\nthe nitresamtnes.\n\nDietrich Hoffman, a toxicologist with the\nnoo-profit American Health Foundation In\nNew York, said \u201cthe concept Is good,\u201d but\nhe would have to see the data to know If the\n\ndevelopment is a true breakthrough. Tobac-. ,\n\nco analyst John Maxwell Jr. doesa't think\nthe CA. Blockers announcement yesterday\nts Significant for the tobacco industry, It has\nDever been \u2018proven that tobacco products\ncontain carcinogenic substances, he said,\nThe additive \u201cIsn't gatag to get very far wun\nthe tobacco industry because (hey feel there\nisn\u2019t anything to block,\u201d he said.\n\n \n\nA spokeswoman for R.J, Reyna\nolds Tobacco Co. said more work\nneeds to be done before scientists\n\n_ Can evaluate the additive,\n\nKeeney said the additive would\nnot be subject to approval from the\nfederal Food and Drug Administra-\n\n\u2018on because it's a cigarette-reiated\n\nproduct and the FDA doesn't regu-\nlate clgaretes. .\n\n. Keeney, 36, worked In markeUng\nat. Brown & Williamson for about\nthree years. He and seven \u2018other\nshhreholders formed CA. Blockers\nlegs than two year ago after they\nacquired the patent and research\nwork for the technology that neu-\ntrallzes nltrosamines from Waddell\nand Carolyo Marlowe, a medical\nschool research associate marred\nto Waddell.\n\nThe company, which has no es\nto any tobacco company, went pub-\nlic in October, Keeney sald.

(HBI)\n10378 Democracy Lane\nFairfax, Virginia 22030\nU.S.A.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA commonly seen method of indoor air evaluations in buildings perceived\nas \u201csick\" involves an engineering study of a building in conjunction with a\nquestionnaire administered to its occupants. As a result we now have evidence\nthat tighter, air conditioned buildings generate higher incidence of upper\nrespiratory complaints than naturally ventilated buildings.':? However, this\ncombination of engineering evaluation and occupant questionnaire as a\ndiagnostic method for sick buildings has not provided us with the ability to\npredict the cause of indoor air problems from occupant symptoms.\n\nOne major reason for this appears to be that many common irritants found\nin indoor air result in a similar range of upper respiratory symptoms. Many\ndiagnosed \u201csick\" buildings are reported to have their causes rooted in\nventilation, filtration or hygiene problems which allow a mixture of low level\npollutants to build up 2-4 These irritate occupants in a complex and\npossibly synergistic manner, the mechanism of which is largely unknown to us.\n\nTo demonstrate the range of engineering characteristics which can produce\nsimilar complaints of sick building syndrome, this paper presents two case\nhistories of identically sized buildings, the studies of which were completed\nin July of 1989. One of these buildings (designated as Building A) was\nlocated in Washington D.C., and the other (designated as Building 3) was\nlocated in San Diego, California. Both buildings are 600,000 square feet in\nsize and a full description of their respective characteristics is found in\nthe results section.\n\nSymptomology\n\nThe following symptoms were reported in Building A during the year\nprevious to this study: sneezing and/or coughing; sinus congestion; dry nasal\npassages; post nasal drip; rashes amd dry skin; headache; breathing\ndifficulties; sore throat; drowsiness; fatigue; eye irritation. In Building 5\nthe following complaints were noted over the same period of time: odors;\nheadaches; shortness of breath; eye irritation; dizziness. These symptoms in\nboth buildings compare well with the classic symptomology of the sick building\nsyndrome as defined in the Commission of the European Communities Report --\nSick Building Syndrome, A Practical Guide) which lists the symptoms as\nfollows: nasal irritation with nasal stuffiness; dryness and irritation of the\nmucous membrane of the eye; dryness and irritation of the throat; skin dryness\nand irritation; headaches, generalized lethargy and tiredness.\n\nTI0991-0500",

Duration of exposure was 60 minutes\nand CO was continuously monitored by IR-spectroscopy. Objective (eye blinks, la-\ncrymal flow, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration) as well as subjective\nmeasures based on questionnaire items were taken at 20' intervals. COHb was mea-~\nsured before and after ETS-exposure. Significant effects of exposure were found\nfor blinks, lacrymal flow, COHb, as well as for most of the questionnaire-based\ninformation. With the exception of the questionnaire-variables, exhibiting dose-\nresponse-relationship, the majority of dependent variables showed clear threshold\ncharacteristics: The 15 ppm-condition only was significantly different from the\ncontrol level. From this finding the tentative conclusion is drawn for a no-ad-\nverse effect-level for ETS to be located between 5 and 15 ppm, rather than below\n5 ppm. (WINNEKE et al., 1984).\n\nIn order to substantiate this conclusion and to gain information about the\ngeneralizability of the annoyance-response a second extended study (II) was con-\nGucted, in which the psychophysiological effects of ETS\u2014exposure will be compared\nto those of noise- and odour-exposure; this study is not yet completed. The Ss of\nthis study were selected from the general population living in noise- and odor-\nproblem-areas of the city of Diisseldorf. Based on a social survey covering 2300\nindividuals only non-smokers from extreme groups with high or low annoyance\ncharacteristics, respectively, were asked to participate in the experimental part\nof the study. These were exposed in a social setting to ETS corresponding to aco\nof 0, 5 and 10 ppm. Apart from few technical modifications the set of outccome-\nmeasures as well as the basic experimental structure was identical to that of the\npilot study (I). Results based on the first set of 72 Ss will be presented and\ndiscussed.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nWinneke,G., K.Plischke, A.Roscovanu, and H.-W.Schlipk\u00e9ter: Patterns and Determi-\nnants of Reaction to Tobacco Smoke in an Experimental Exposure Setting\nIn: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Idoor Air Quali-\nty and Climate, vol.2, 351-356 (1984)\n\n6ene \u00a3b90S",

Consequently, we have been\npursuing the development of our own series. Preliminary results are quite\nencouraging.\n\nThis memo covers my comments on the Southampton Report and the status of\nour developmental work.\n\nO6-R\n\n  \n\nAd Comments on R&DE Report Ri\n\nJeremy Wood's report contains several points of immediate importance in\nview of on-going WOODROSE activities and current R&D projects.\n\n1. The new series of nine impact standards are designed to give more\nprecise determinations than the previous standards, covering the\nsame impact sensation range (0 to 4 is now 1 to 9).\n\n2. The filter cigarettes are available from R&DE and Wood makes the\nrecommendation that the new standards be used by all panels using\nWOODROSE .\n\n3. Very casually in passing, Wood makes the comment that impact \"should\nbe based on the whole cigarette and not merely on the first few puffs.\"\nThis is news to me.\n\n \n\nThe new series is based on the relationship between extractable nicotine\ndelivery and impact. The desired levels of impact sensation are produced\nby blends of two flue-cured tobaccos, widely differing in nicotine concent,\nin proportions to yield theoretical nicotine deliveries, which give just\nnoticeable differences (j.n.d.) in impact. Calculations for the tobacco\nblend formulations are based on the theory that the difference between two\nstimuli is what is important in determining j.n.d. and net absolete values,\n\nThe impact standards, identified as IMP/1, IMP/2...IMP/9, were evaluated\nby \"blind\" panel testing. Ten members scored, by the old scale, adjacent\npairs from memory, i.e., no standards were used. The panel average re-\nsults ranged from 0.56 for IMP/1 to 3.50 for IMP/9 with all samples falling\nin the \"carrect\" sequence. However, for three of the adjacent pairs,\n\n \n\n \n\nDvooe, D.

Devel Conference On Lipids -\n\nThe Deuel Conference on Lipids was oeeanitred by a \u2018gnall group\nof eminent West Coast scientists interested in lipid. research, to\nprovide for the western. states a conference on lipids similar to\nthe Gordon Conferences. Shortly after it\u2019 was organized, one of the\nfounders, Harry Deuel, died. and the conference was named in his\nmemory. The conference has been held annually since about 1955 in:\nvarious West Coast locations.\n\nGenerally the.-conference. is devoted to one or two. subjects and\nboth basic and- clinical materials are presented. The two,.and\none-half day conference consists of five sessions beginning Wednes-\nday or Thursday morning and: running until Friday or Saturday;.. and\nis held in late. February or early. March. . Each session is\nintroduced by a speaker chosen for his or her high stature. in the\nfield. These speakers review their own and related work. Each re-\n\n\u201cview is followed by a few small presentations and -general\ndiscussion of a disease process. Informality and wide interchange\n\nof information and views. are encouraged by. limiting-the size of. the.\ngroups, by the round table format, and by not. recording or publish-_\ning the discussions.\n\nUntil \u201c1968, - the conferences were organized\u2019 by Dr. L.W.\nKinsell, and since that. time they have continued under a broadly. -\nbased rotating leadership.. The original policies. of the conference -\nhave been preserved to keep within the traditional budget, to main-\ntain the informal atmosphere, and.to provide the depth and breadth \u2014\nof expertise necessary, for a high quality conference.\n\nThe attendance has: been kept at less than 100 persons to in-.\nsure informality. A few established investigators in the field of\nlipids, mostly from west of the Continental Divide,. are regularly.\ninvited to attend. Lipid scientists in the west are informed. of\nthe coming program and are invited. to-apply for a place around. the\ntable. The Program Chairman. selects: participants on the basis of .\nrelationship of the research interests of \u2018applicants to. the pro-\ngram. These participants are expected to provide their own travel |\nand living expenses. All. attendees are expected to be present. for\nthe entire conference. .\n\nThe funds to. defray the expense of speakers and conference\ncosts are sought from industrial firms which have a general \u2018inter-\nest. in the area of lipids. Donors are extended the privilege of\nsending a participant(s) to the conference. However, because of .\nthe limited size and the increasing interest in the conference, it.\nhas become necessary recently to adopt the policy of. restricting\nthe participants of the supporting firms to two, with a minimum\ndonation of $1500 per attendee.\n\nE.L.

INITIATING VERSUS DEVELOPMENTAL INFLUENCES\n\nGeneral Comments\n\nIt is obviously difficult to separate influences on the initiation\nof cardiovasculer diseases and tnose which affect the development of such\ndiseases once they are established.\n\nThis is especially true where recognition and classification of the\ndisease occur only after other symptoms exist, as is usually the case.\n\nAs might be expected, there is no hard and fast rule or universally\nconsistent clinical opinion on this matter. It is clear that individuals\ndiffer in response to smoking and to their deprivation from the habit.\n\nFurther research may conceivably indicate that a sufficiently high\npercentage of those with established degrees of cardiovascular disorders will\nreact so unfavorably to smoking as to justify medical advice on certain coursed\nof restrictive action. This, however, is properly a matter of relationship\nbetween the individual doctor and his patient. The desired situation is one\nwhich will involve es broad and comprehensive knowledge as can possibly be\nacquired to guide the profession in the light of its clinical experience.\n\nThe references appended will present opinions which are based on\nsuch experience. They should be considered as being contributory rather than\nconclusive and as being selected for purposes of comparison.\n\nThe important point is that more refined and sophisticated\nlongitudinal studies of controlled populations of apparently normal individuals\nare sorely needed. These should aid in refining our recognition of departures\nfrom normalcy which represent the earliest evidence of the diseases under\nstudy and which, therefore, may be closely connected with their origin.\n\nSimilarly, manipulable populations of patients with established\nearly cardiovascular diseases should provide material for more sophisticated\nclinical studies of factors which may influence the progress and course of\nthese diseases.\n\nUntil such studies are organized and bear fruit we shall have to\nbe content with a type of evidence which leaves doubt as to whether we are\ndealing with factors which influence origin alone, progressive development\nalone, or both.\n\nOcular, Cerebral and Other\nPeripheral Circulation\n\nAccording to Bettman, Fellows, et al., the effect of cigarette\nsmoking on intraocular blood volume in man is net known. \u2018They have, therefore,\nused animals for experimentation.\n\nIf the cigarette was smoked at the normal rate there was no\neffect. If it was smoked rapidly there was a significant rise in intraocular\nvolume. Denicotinized cigarettes gave generally similar results.",

It is theoretically possible that the\ndietary deficiency could condition the oral tissues or be a predisposing factor en-\nabling the carcinogen present in the tobacco condensate to induce the development\nof a cancerous process. The role of alcohol may be that of a synergistic direct\nirritant, or indirectly by its action on the liver to effect degenerative changes\nleading to cirrhosis; thus impairing an important immune center of the body.\n\nExperimently, it is the purpose of this project to induce in laboratory animals\n(white mice) cancer of the oral tissues by combining the factors, tobacco condensates,\nalcohol, and dietary deficiencies.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\n\nSix groups of white mice, each group to consist of ten mice will be subjected to\nvariations of tobacco application, alcohol and diet. A control group will be in-\ncluded. The tobacco condensate will be diluted in 50% acetone and will be painted\non the oral mucosa four times weekly. The alcohol will be placed in the arinictng\nwater of the animals and changed completely four times weekly. A 10% solution of\na standard brand of whiskey will be used.

Weber,\nAlan Wolfman\n\n\u2018The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)\u2014binding protein Ras functions in regulating growth and\ndifferentiation; however, little is known about the protein interactions that bring about its\nbiological activity. Wild-type Ras or mutant forms of Ras were covalently attached to an\ninsoluble matrix and then used to examine the interaction of signaling proteins with Ras.\nForms of Ras activated either by mutation (Gly12Val) or by binding of the GTP analog,\nguanylyl-imidodiptiosphate (GMP-PNP) interacted specifically with Raf-1 whereas an ef-\nfector domain mutant, lle36Ala, failed to interact with Raf-1. Mitogen-activated protein\nkinase (MAP kinase) activity was only associated with activated forms of Ras. The specific\ninteraction of activated Ras with active MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) was confirmed by\ndirect assays. Thus the forming of complexes containing MAPKK activity and Raf-1 protein\n\nare dependent upon the activity of Ras.\n\n \n\nThe majority of cellular Ras in quiescent\ncells is in the inactive guanosine diphos-\nphate (GDP)-bound. conformation. Stimu-\nlation of cells with mitogens or differentia-\ntion factors increases the abundance of the\nactive GTP-bound form of Ras (1). The\nactivity of Ras is required for regulatory\nsignaling by plasma membrane tyrosine ki-\nnase oncogenes and receptors (2). Blocking\nthe action of Ras, either by microinjection\nof antibodies or through the expression of a\ndominant negative mutant, prevents the\nactivation of the cytosolic serine-threonine\nprotein kinases Raf-1 and MAP kinase (3,\n4). The expression of activated Ras, either\nin whole cells or in vitro activates thesc\ncytosolic serine-threanine protein kinases\n\n\u00a7. A. Moodie and A. Wolfman, Oepartment of Cell\nBiology, Cleveland Clinic foundation, 9500 Euclid\nAvenue, Cleveland, OH 44106.\n\n8. M. Willumsen, Institute of Microbiology, University\nof Copenhagen, @ster Farimagsgade 2A, OK 1353\nCopenhagen, Denmark.\n\nM.

These cytosolic enzymes can func-\ntion as part of a kinase cascade, in which\nMAP kinases are activated by a MAPKK\n(8), which in turn can be phosphorylated\nand activated by the Raf-1 protein kinase\n(9). The components of this pathway may\nnot always be coupled to each other, how-\never, because neither Ras or Raf-1 activates\nMAP kinases in Ratla cells (10).\n\nThough it is clear that Ras participates\nin signaling between the cell membrane\nand the cytosol, the biochemical interac-\ntions that mediate the action of Ras are\npoorly understood. To determine if Ras\nmight physically interact with cytosolic\nsignaling components in a GTP-depen-\ndent manner, we covalently bound recom-\nbinant c-Ha-Ras (referred to as Ras) to\nsilica beads activated by an N-hydroxyl\nsuccinimide group (11, 12). The coupled\nRas was active in binding guanine nucle-\notides and has been used to examine\ninteractions between Ras and neurofbro-\nmin, a regulator of Ras function (12). The\nimmobilized Ras was used to probe rat\nbrain cytosol for signaling proteins that\n\nSCIENCE * VOL. 260 * 11 JUNE 1993\n\n50648850\n\nspecifically interacted with Ras-GTP.\n\nImmobilized Ras bound to GMP-PNP. (a\u201d\u201d\nnonhydrolyzable GTP analog) formed a sta-\nble complex with Raf-1 (Fig. 1A). Approx-\nimately 15% of the total cytosolic Raf-1\nassociated with immobilized Ras-GMP-\nPNP.

At zero voltage, the Cs* conductance is approximately\n15-fold lower than the corresponding K* conductance. The open channel rectifies strongly in symmetrical Cs* solutions,\nand the Cs* currents are independent of Cs* concentration in the range 18-600 mM. Biionic (Cs*/K*) reversal\npotentials are only 10 mV, showing that Cs\u201d is nearly as permeant as K\u2018, though much less conductive. Addition of Cs*\nto symmetrical K* solutions reduces current through the channel ia a voltage-dependent way. The results can be\nexplained by a free energy profile in which the channel\u2019s selectivity filter acts in two ways: to provide binding sites for\nthe conducting ions and to serve as a major rate-determining structure. According to this picture, the main difference\nbetween high-conductance K* and low-conductance Cs* is that Cs* binds toan asymmetrically positioned site ~20-fold\n\nmore tightly than does K*.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nVirtually all K*-selective ion channels interact strongly\nwith Cs*. Indeed, there is no known case in which a K*\nchanne!\u2014that is, an ion channel with a substantial select-\nivity for K* over Na*\u2014is not profoundly affected by Cs*\nin the millimolar range. In all cases studied, Cs* reduces\nK* current through the open channel, i.\u00a2., it blocks the\nchannel. The common mechanistic picture of this interac-\ntion is analogous to competitive inhibition in enzyme\nkinetics: the Cs* ion can enter the normal K* conduction\npathway, but cannot permeate it. Whenever a Cs* jon is\nthus stuck in the open channel, K+ ions are literally\nblocked from permeating. K* ions must wait for the Cs*\nion to leave the channel via the same route that it had\nentered before they can traverse the pore. Though many\nvariations in detail have been offered in the literature of\nCs* block of K* channels, such studies are usually inter-\npreted in terms of these basic elements: the strong binding\nand nonpermeation of the Cs* ion.\n\nThis picture is reasonable. A K*-selective site of low\nfield strength may easily be expected to bind Cs* more\nstrongly than K* (Eisenman, 1961). Since Cs* is slightly\nlarger than K* (0.31 vs. 0.27 nm diameter, respectively), it\nis plausible to propose that simple steric hindrance\naccounts for the failure of Cs* to permeate the selectivity\nfilter of a K* channel.\n\nThis study is concerned with Cs* block of a K*-selective\n\nDr. Cukierman\u2019s permanent address is Instituto de Biofisica, Universi-\ndade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, 21941 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nBiopnys.

                "text": "PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Disturbances in hematopoiesis is a characteristic clinical finding in patients\nwith AIDS. Patients present with abnormalities in one or more lineages resulting in neutropenia, anemia and\nthrombocytopenia. The mechanisms by which HIV causes these disturbances are not known but are critical to\nan understanding of the hematologic pathobiology of the virus and the clinical management of patients with\nAIDS. In this grant, we propose to examine the molecular basis for our published findings of two mechanisms\nby which HIV can cause disturbances in hematopoiesis: direct suppression of progenitor cell growth and\ndifferentiation; and a negative effect on the accessory hematopoietic support function (HSF) of stroma cells.\nUsing a murine embryonic stem cell (ES) line, as a model for stem cell development, and human stroma cell\nlines, transfection experiments will focus primarily on the role of the vpr regulatory gene in altering the\ndevelopmental and functional properties of these hematopoietic cells. This focus is based on the observation:\nthat vpr transfected into a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line can induce its differentiation. Thus, vpr may cause a\ndisruption of the carefully regulated and coordinated processes of proliferation and differentiation that\noccurs during the development of progenitor cells into mature and functional progeny. A disruption in the\nfunction of stroma cells may similarly be affected by the activity of the vpr gene.\n\nIn their paper on HIV induction of rhabdomyosarcoma muscle celi line differentiation, Levi and co-\nworkers showed that HIV expression leads to inhibition of the muscle cell's proliferation and the activation of\nthe dormant endogenous differentiation Program. The effect was mediated by the regulatory vpr gene of the\nvirus with its protein acting as a regulator of cell function. In discussing the implications of these findings,\nthe authors speculate that \u201cstem cell populations (e.g., skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, hematopoietic pre-\ncursors) are disrupted by vor and lose the ability to replenish tissues, leading to a gradual decline of mature\neffector population.\" Since some viruses can activate cellular genes in a variety of cells, it is reasonable to\nexamine whether HIV regulatory genes can induce changes in the normal pattern of gene expression in\nhematopoietic progenitor celts and the accessory Cell function of stroma cells. Such an approach may provide\nevidence for the dysregulation of proliferation and differentiation as a mechanism of bone marrow suppress-\nion. The authors also postulate that \u201ccells that are subject to abortive infection, owing to an inability of the\ncells to support virus replication, nevertheless might be dysregulated by the activities of vpr.\". Thus, non-\nproductively infected cells of tissues that are not the usual targets of HIV in vivo, but are afflicted in AIDS\npatients, may be dysregulated in the absence of reverse transcription, integration, or residual viral nucleic\nacid. This may explain the consistent lack of evidence for a direct effect on progenitor cells in in vivo studies\nwhile in vitro experiments demonstrate that progenitor cells can be infected by HIV and their growth\nimpaired. Though replication of the virus is, perhaps dogmatically, the yardstick by which a cell's tropism\nfor HIV is measured, it is possible that abortive infection of a cell that is not the usual target of the virus can\nstill alter the function of that cell. In this context, the marked suppression of progenitor cell growth in\nvitro following infection by hepatitis B virus correlates with only a transient replication of the virus in\nbone marrow cultures. We postulate, therefore, that while bone marrow progenitor cells or stroma cells\nmay not be the primary target cell of HIV in situ, abortive infection may still have negative consequences on\ntheir development and function.\n\nOur first aim is to determine whether the vpr gene of HIV is responsible for the suppression of\nhematopoietic progenitor cells. The mouse embryonic siem cell (ES) is a totipotential cell line that has the\nCapacity to develop into every tissue type when injected into host blastocysts. As such, it has become a\nvaluable tool in the study of hematopoiesis and its molecular biology, and so will be used as a developmental\nmodel of hematopoiesis in these studies. Several characteristics of ES cells make it a good model to define the\nrole of vpr (and other regulatory genes) in stem cell suppression, and a good substitute for primary bone\nmarrow derived CD34+ cells whose use in similar studies may be technically more difficult. Since ES cells\nare a pure population of truly totipotential cells, they can be used to gain insight into the biological\nsignificance of novel genes, and dissect the molecular processes that occur during the early events of\ncommitment, self-renewal, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, in vitro\ntechniques have been developed to study hematopoietic cell differentiation in ES cells, and the profile and\npattern of genes activated during this process have been characterized and are consistent and reproducible.\nThus, the expression of genes involved in the early stages of hematopoiesis precede those required for the\nterminal stages of differentiation. Alterations in the normal process of differentiation is reflected in a\ndistorted profile of gene expression. These observations are relevant to the proposed study.

                "text": "PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Disturbances in hematopoiesis is a characleristic clinical   finding in palients with AIDS. Patients present with abnormalities in one or more lineages resulting in neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia, The mechanisms by which HIV causes these disturbances are not known but are critical to an understanding of the hematologic pathobiology of the virus and ihe clinical managemeni of patients with AIDS. In this grant, we propose to examine the molecular basis for our published findings of two mechanisms by_which HIV can cause disturbances in hematopoiesis: direct suppression of progenitor cell growlh and differentiation; and 3 negative 9ffect on the accessory hematopoietic support function (HSF) of stroma cells. Using a murine embryonic stem cell (ES) line, a8 a model for stem celi development; and human stroma cell lines,  transfection  experiments will focus primarily on the role of the vpr  regulatory gene in altering the developmental and functional properties of these hematopoietic cells: This focus is based on the observation Ihat vpr transfected into a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line can induce its differentiation; Thus, vpr may cause a disruption of the carefully   regulated and coordinated processes of proliferation and differentiation that occurs during Ihe development of progenitor cells into mature and functional progeny: A disruption in the function %f stroma cells may similarly be affected by the activity of the vpr gene  In their paper on HIV induction of rhabdomyosarcoma muscle cell line differentiation, Levi and CO- workers showed that HIV expression leads to inhibition of the muscle cell's proliferation and the activation of the dormant erdogenous ditferentiation   program. The effect was mediated by the regulatory vpr gene of the virus with its protein acting as a regulator of cell function; In discussing the implications of these findings, the authors speculate that \"stem celi populations (e.g, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, hematopoietic pre cursors) are disrupted by vpr and lose Ihe ability to replenish tissues, leading to a gradual decline of mature effector population:' Since some viruses can activate cellular genes in a variety of cells, it is reasonable t0 examine whether HIV regulatory genes can induce changes in the normal pattern of gene expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells and the accessory cell function of slroma cells. Such an approach may provide evidence for the dysregulation of proliferation and differentiation as a mechanism of bone marrow suppress- ion. The authors also postulate that \"cells that are subject to abortive infection, owing to an inability of the cells to support virus replication, nevertheless might be dysregulated by the activities of vpr.' Thus, non- productively  infected cells of tissues that are not the usual targets of HIV in vivo, but are afflicted in AIDS patients; may be dysregulated in the absence of reverse transcription, integration, or residual viral   nucleic acid , This may explain the consistent lack of evidence for a direct effect o progenitor cells in in vivo studies while in vitro experiments   demonstrate Ihat progenitor cells can be infected by HIV and their   growth impaired: Though replication of the virus is, perhaps dogmatically , the yardstick by which a cell's tropism for HIV is measured; it is possible that aborlive infection of & cell ihat is not the usual target of Ihe virus can still alter the function of that cell. In this context, the marked suppression of progenitor cell growth in vitro   following infection by hepatitis B virus  correlates with only a transient  replication of the virus in bone marrow cultures. We postulate, therefore, that while bone marrow progenitor cells or stroma cells mhay not be the primary target cell of HIV in situ, abortive infection may still have negative consequences o their development and function. Our first aim is to determine whether the vpr gene of HIV is responsible for the suppression of hematopoietic progenitor cells: The mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) is a totipotential cell Iine that has the capacity to develop into every tissue type when injected  into host blastocysts. As such , it has become a valuable tool in the study of hematopoiesis ad its molecular biology, and so will b8 used as a developmental model of hematopoiesis in these studies. Several characteristics of ES cells make it a good model to define the role of vpr (and other regulatory genes) in stem cell suppression, and a good substitute for primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells whose use in similar studies may be technically more difficull: Since ES cells are a pure population of truly totipotential cells , they can be used to insight into the biological significance of novel genes, and dissect the molecular  processes that occur during the early events of commitment, self-renewal, and differentiation of  hematopoietic   progenitor cells. Furthermore, in vitro techniques have been developed to study hematopoietic celi differentiation in ES cells, and the profile and pattern of genes activated during this process have been characterized and are consisient and reproducible. Thus,  the expression %f genes involved in the early stages of hemalopoiesis precede those required for {he terminal stages of differentiation. Alterations in the normal process of differentiation is reflected in a distorted profile  of gere expression These observations are relevant to the proposed study _ Finally , based on our sludies on studies of the vav proto-oncogene, genes of particular interest can be readily and stably 50647413 gain",

Gallagher\n\nTitle of Original Grant: Nicotine and Its Direct Inhibitory Action in the Rat Septal Nuclei\n\nBelow are the four specific aims that were outlined to achieve the following overall objective, namely, to\nanalyze in detail the membrane mechanisms by which nicotine activates a specific nicotinic receptor on septal\nneurons to yield inhibition.\n\nA) Since nicotine hyperpolarizes directly dorsolateral septal neurons, we need to determine: the\ncharacteristics of the receptor responsible; the ionic specics and channel to which this receptor is\ncoupled; and whether nicotine may also alter ion channels localized within the postsynaptic membrane\nthat are not coupled to this nicotinic receptor.\n\nB) We will determine how nicotine modulates synaptic transmission as recorded within our septal slice\npreparation, namely: 1) excitatory acid mediated excitatory transmission and 2) GABA mediated\ninhibitory transmission. These studies will include experiments to distinguish pre- and/or post-synaptic\nactions.\n\nC) We will determine how nicotine interacts with several substances that we or others have demonstrated\nhave biological activity within the septum, These substances are endogenous transmitters or\nmodulators, \u00a2.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, somatostatin, etc.; or drugs, e.g., barbiturates,\nbenzodiazepines, alcohol, etc.\n\nD) Finally, using freshly dissociated septal neurons with patch clamp methodology we will examine the\nspecific channels opened by nicotine and determine which, if any second-messenger systems may be\nassociated with CNS nicotinic receptor activation.\n\nmmary of results according to four specific aims stated above:\n@ 1. Nicotine hyperpolarizes DLSN neurons\n\na. Receptor type - Non - skeletal muscle nicotinic receptor\n\n- somewhat sensitive to mecamylamine, but not sensitive to hexamethonium or d-tubocurarine\n\n- completely blocked by kappa-BGTX (neuronal bungarotoxin)\n\nb. Ionic species and channel coupled to CNS nicotinic receptor responsible for hyperpolarization.\n\n- K* - channel\n\n- Ca** - dependent, but does not require initial depolarization.\n\n: response blocked by intracellular injection of GTA, while hyperpolarizations resulting from\napplication of serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine persist.\n\n- response persists after pertussis toxin treatment which blocks GABA,-induced\n\nhyperpolarization.\n2. Nicotine can also depolarize these same neurons.\na. Receptor type - different from hyperpolarization, since mecamylamine enhances depolarization.\nb. lonic Species - unknown, presently\n- depolarization associated with decreased conductance, maybe potassium\nion,\nB, Nicotine alters synaptic transmission\n1, Nicotine primarily acts to depress late hyperpolarizing response (LHP) and then fast inhibitory\npostsynaptic potential (IPSP). There appears to be little effect on excitatory synaptic potential,\nbut additional experimetns using both non-NMDA and NMDA antagonists are required.\n& Nicotine interaction with other substances - to be done.\nND. Nicotine action on freshly dissociated neurons - ta be done.\n\nesse see attached manuscript submitted to Nature and two abstracts.",

Gallagher Title of Original Grant: Nicotine and Its Iirect Inhibitory Action in the Rat Scptal Nuclei Below are the four specific aims that were outlined to achievc the following overall objective, namely, to analyze in detail the membrane mechanisms by which nicotine activates a specilic nicotinic receptor On scptal neurons to yield inhibition Since   nicotine   hyperpolarizes   directly   dorsolateral  septal   neurons, we need to determine: the characteristics of the receptor responsible; the ionic specics and channel to which this reccptor is coupled; and whether nicotine may also alter ion channels localized within the postsynaptic mcmbrane that are not coupled to this nicotinic receptor, B3) We will determine how nicotine modulates synaptic transmission as recorded within our scptal slice preparation, namely: 1) excitatory acid mediated excitatory transmission and 2) GABA medialed inhibitory transmission These studies will includc experiments to distinguish pre-and /or post-synaptic actions We will determine how nicotine interacts with several suhstances that wc O others have demonstrated have   biological   activity within the   seplum; These substances are endogenous   transmitters or modulators, c-g,, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, somatostatin, etc;; or e.g;, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, etc, D) Finally, freshly dissociated septal neurons with patch methodology we will examine the channels opened by nicotine and determine which, if second-messenger systems may be associated with CNS nicotinic receptor activation; mnmary 0f results according t0 four specilic aims stated above: 1. Nicotine hyperpolarizes DLSN neurons a. Receptor type Non skeletal muscle nicotinic receptor somewhat sensitive to mecanylamine, but not sensitive to hexamethonium Or d-tubocurarine completely blocked by kappa-BGTX (neuronal bungarotoxin) Ionic spccies and channel coupled to CNS nicotinic receptor responsible for hyperpolarization  K channel Ca dependent, but does not rcquire initial depolarization. response blocked by intracellular injection of EGTA, while hyperpolarizations resulting from application of serotonin; norepinephrine O dopamine persisi: response persists after pertussis toxin treatment which blocks GABAe-induced hyperpolarization. 2 Nicotine can also depolarize these same neurons. a Receptor lype different from hyperpolarization, since mecamylamine enhauces depolarization. b Jonic Species unknown, presently depolarization associated with decreased conduclance, mayhe potassium ion; K. Nicotine alters synaptic transmission 1, Nicotine primarily acts to depress Jate hyperpolarizing response (IJIP) and then fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). There appears to be littlc effect on excitatory synaptic potentiai, but additional expcrimetns using both non-NMDA and NMDA antagonists are required  C.

Immunologic and\nphysicokinetic studies revealed the occurrence of four classes\nuf PBG-deaminase mutations. In the majority of families\nstudied, the amount of immunoreactive enzyme protein curre-\nsponded to the amount of enzymatic activity, indicating the\nabsence of cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM) pro-\nduced by the mutant allele, In 78 of these CRIM-negative\nfamilies (designated type 1), the affected heterozygotes had\nhalf-normal PBG-deaminase activity. In three families (desig-\nnated CRIM-negative type 2). symptomatic patients had in-\ncreased urinary excretion of j-aminolevulinic acid and PBG,\nand normal levels of erythrocyte PBG-deaminase activity. In\ncoutrast, noncatalytic, immunoreactive protein was expressed\nin heterozygotes from [ft families, about one-eighth of those\nstudied, consistent with mutations in the structural gene for\nPBG-deaminase, Two types of CRIM-positive mutations were\nidentified: the type | mutation had a CRIM /activity ratio of\n~1.7 and a crossed-immunoelectrophoretic profile in which all\nthe enzyme intermediates were increased, with the B or mono-\npyrrole-enzyme intermediate predominant (B > A > C ~ D\n> E). The mutation altered both the kinetic and stability\nproperties of the noncatalytic immunoreactive enzyme protein.\nThe second CRIM-positive mutation, type 2, had markedly\nincreased levels of noncatalytic immunoreactive protein (CRINI/\nactivity ratio ~ 5.7), Crossed-immunoelectrophoresis revealed\nmarkedly increased amounts of the substrate-bound interme-\ndiates, B, C, D, and E(B > \u20acC > D> E\u00ae A). The accumulation\nof these noncatalytic enzyme intermediates presumably resulted\nfrom the enhanced binding and/or defective release of substrate\nmatlecules.

The\nobjectives in doing so are:\n\n(a) Yo emphasize the need for developing a perspective that\nwill lead to the eventual evaluation of the various\nsuspected factors as being independent, correlated,\ncumulative, antagonistic or synergistic agents in the\norigin and/or progressive development of cardiovascular\ndisease.\n\n(b) To indicate possible variables in connection with which\nsmokers of various types and degrees may be contrasted\nwith non-smokers or with those who have discontinued\nsmoking for different periods of time.\n\nMultifactorial Studies\n\nSeveral multifactorial prospective studies \u00bb particularly those of\nthe Framingham group, of the Albany group, of Stamler and of Oglesby Paul have\nendeavored to reach a profile description of the coronary-prone individual.\nFor such purposes, it has been necessary to employ available clinical\ndefinitions of the various cardiovascular conditions, in order to relate\nincidence epidemiologically to constitutional and environmental factors. \u2018In\ngeneral, the lack of autopsy date has been recognized as a serious handicap\nto precise description and classification.\n\nSome degree of success has been attained in reaching a profile\ndescription. Hereditary factors seem to be quite generally recognized.\nEpidemiologically, a rather persistent association between prevailing high\nserum cholesterol levels and risk of developing cardiovascular disease has\nbeen reported. High prevailing blood pressures \u00bb overweight, cigarette smoking,\nleft ventricular hypertrophy, low vital capacity, history of shortness of\nbreath, history of peptic ulcer, history of chest discomfort, A-V nicking of\nthe fundi, and heavy use of coffee have been reported also to show various\ndegrees of association. Combinations of certain of these factors are\nassociated with higher risk in some reports, but not in others.\n\nOf course, no studies of this kind can be used alone to determine\nwhether any one or any combination of the measured factors actually contri-\nbutes causally to production of disease or whether they tend rather to reflect\nthe existence of some constellation of more basic congenital predisposing\ncharacteristics which result in higher disease incidence. For example,\nvoluntary cessation of cigarette smoking may itself reflect selective\nconstitutional differences. The inevitable uncertainties inherent in these\nstudies are recognized as being a severe handicap to design of effective\npreventive measures.\n\nIt is of interest that cigarette smoking does not appear to be\nassociated with development of chronic angina. Since this disease is\nconsidered to be & consequence of general atherosclerotic narrowing of the\ncoronary arteries, this lack of association has been interpreted as indicating",

It has been assumed in most previous studies in\nthis area (1, 2, 6, 7, 16. 17, 19, 25, 26, 27, 29) that\nsome form of reciprocal relationship exists betmeen\nproduct attitude or consumption and specific personality\ntraits. There is evidence [4, 8. 11. 12, 14] which suggests\nthat personality in itself-is affected by heredity. In this\narticle we shall examine the extent to which heredity can\nexplain the variance in specific personality traits, prod-\nuct attitude, and product consumption, individually as\nwell as their interrelationships. :\n\nThe selection of products and personality traits for\nthis study was based on results from previous studies.\nFor personality traits, extraversion-introversion (ET) and\nanxiety (A) were sclected using scales devised by Ey.\nsenck [10] and Bendig [3} respectively. Eysenck und\nPrell {13}, EysencK T9}. and Shiclds [20] found these\ntraits to have a significant genetic componcnt. For prod-\nuct attitude und consumption, cigurcttes, coffee, und_al-\ncohol were selected for two reasons. First. consumers of\nthe products tend to develop hubitual patterns of con-\nsumption, making it difficult for them ty stop. Second,\nPartanen, Bruun, and Markkanen (18] in a study of the\ninheritance of alcoholic drinking, coffee_drinking, and\ncigurette_ smoking behavior found that, of the alcoholic\ndrinking variables, densiry (a combined factor of fre-\n\n       \n\n \n\n\u00ae Arnon Perry is a lecturer at The Leon Recanati Graduate\nSchool of Business Administration, Tel-Aviv University. He is\ngtateful for the constructive comments, counsel, and assistince\nin this research of Professors Edwatd Cundiff, S. Thomas Fried-\nman, and Mack Alpert of The University of Texas at Austin.\n\n \n\n \n\n\u2018quency and regularity) and amount showed a significant\nheritability. Both coffee drinking and cigarette smoking\n\nshowed _a significant heritability on the amount con-\nsumed. Although the relationship, if any, between ha-\n\nbitual consumption and heredity has not been estab-.\nlished, it is not unreasonable to hypothesize a relationship\nbetwcen the two. ,\nSome evidence was introduced by Smart [21], who\nfound acurvilinear relationship between anxiety and the\nfrequency of drinking among college students, using\nTaylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale. Eysenck [12] found\n\u201cextraversion to be related to cigarette smoking, and\nSmith (22, 23]. in two separate studies using college stu-\ndents and preudult subjects and a different scale from\nthe one developed by Eysenck, has found that smokers\nscored significantly higher on measures of extraversion.\n\nMETHOD\n\nThe research design employed here calls for a sample\nof MZ! and DZ twins. The underlying principle of the\ntwin method is that MZ twins have identical genotypes,\nand therefore any observed dissimilarity within pairs\nmust be related to environmental factors. DZ, same sex\ntwins, while on the average differing in SO of their\ngenes, provide a measure of environmental conttol not\notherwise possible by sharing such factors as birth rank\nand mother\u2019s age. Once the within-pairs variances (Viz\nand V2) have been calculated, the twin method allows\n\n* Throughout the article the conventional abbreviations MZ\n(for nvonvzygos-identical) and DZ (lor dizygous-fraternal) twins\nare used.

Hogan:|\n\nFrom the EDepartment of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, the \u00a7Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Dana\nFarber Cancer Institute, and the Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115\n\nThe transcription factor NFATp, which has a central\nrole in cytokine gene induction inT cells, was previously\nthought to be expressed only in T cells and other im-\nmune cells. Here we report that NFATp is also expressed\nin the rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line and in the\nmurine nervous system. Antisera against T cell NFATp\nrecognize proteins of similar apparent molecular weight\nin T cells, PC12 cells, and murine olfactory bulb. The\nimmunoreactive proteins from PC12 cells and from ol-\nfactory bulb bind to an NFAT site of the murine inter-\nleukin-2 promoter with the same specificity as T cell\nNFATp. Immunohistochemical staining localizes NFATp\nto neurons, specifically to olfactory receptor neurons\nand to their terminals in the olfactory bulb. The pres-\nence of NFATp in the nervous system suggests that it has\na role in the transcription of specific neuronal genes in\nresponse to increases in cytosolic calcium.\n\nNr\n\nThe transcription factor NFATp is essential for transcription\nof cytokine genes in activated T cells (1-7). NFATp cooperates\nwith Fos and Jun family proteins in the nucleus of stimulated\nT cells to activate transcription of the interleukin-2 (IL-2)! gene\n(8-14) and acts in concert with these or other transcription fac-\ntors to increase transcription of other cytokine genes (3, 4, 6, 12).\nNFAT p was originally identified as the \u201cpreexisting\u201d component\nof the inducible nuclear factor NFAT (8, 13-15); its activation in\nT cells depends on a caleium/calmodulin/caleineurin signaling\npathway and is sensitive to cyclosporin A and FK506 (15, 16).\nNEAT\u00bb is a phosphoprotein of apparent molecular mass ~120\nkDa (11, 15, 17), which exists in T cells as several isoforms aris-\ning from alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts (18).\n\n\u2018A nuclear factor similar or identical to NFATp has also been\nidentified in B ceils (2, 19-21). Extracts of unstimulated B cells\ncontain factors that bind to the distel NFAT site of the IL-2\npromoter and form a complex on this site with Fos and Jun\nfamily proteins (19). As in T cells, the activation of NFAT is\ninitiated by an increase in cytoplasmic calcium and is pre-\nvented by treatment of the cells with cyclosporin A (20, 21).\nAntisera against T cell NFATp recognize the protein-DNA com-\nplexes from B cells\u201d and identify proteins comparable in appar-\nent molecular weight to T cell NFATp in Western analysis of B\ncell proteins.\u2019 Recent work has documented the presence of\n\n* This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health\nGrant CA42471 {to A.

Electrophoretic\nmobility shift assays did not detect proteins that bind to an\nNFAT oligonucleotide in brain or liver extracts (22). In trans-\ngenic mice, expression of a reporter gene under control of a\nmultimer of the NFAT site was restricted almost entirely to\nactivated T cells and B cells and was not apparent in brain (22).\nOn the other hand the components of the caleiumn/calmodulin/\ncaleineurin pathway that activates NFATp in T cells are abun-\ndantly expressed in the brain (23, 24). Likewise, Fos, Jun, and\nother transcription factors that combine with NFAT\u00bb in T cells\nare induced in neural cells by growth factors and other physi-\nological stimuli (25-29).\n\nHere we have reexamined the possibility that NFATp is ex-\npressed in neural cells. We present evidence that NFATp is\nexpressed by the PC12 cell line, a rat adrenal chromaffin tumor\ncell line (30) that has been used in studies of intracellular\nsignaling, transcriptional regulation, and neuronal differentia-\ntion. Further, we demonstrate that NFATp is present at rela-\ntively high levels in the murine olfactory bulb, largely in ter-\nminals of olfactory receptor neurons, and may be expressed at\nlower levels in certain other regions of the murine central nerv-\nous system.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nCell Culture\u2014PC12 cells were maintained in 1.15CO2 medium with\n7% horse serum, 7% fetal calf serum, and other additives as described\n(31). Murine T cell clones Ar-6 and CLL7W2 were grown as described\n(32).\n\nAntisera\u2014The principal antiserum used in these experiments was\naffinity-purified antiserum against peptide 67.1 (AISSPSGLAYPDDV-\nLDYGL), a sequence located near the N terminus of murine NFATp.\nAntiserum was produced by immunization of rabbits with the peptide\nconjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and was purified hy affinity\nchromatography on a resin (Affi-Gel 10, Bio-Rad) bearing immobilized\npeptide 67.1. Other reagents used were antisera against the peptides\n67.2 and 72 (18) and an antiserum directed against a recombinant frag-\nment af NFATp that includes the DNA-binding domain (18).

These\nresults indicate that LV injections might be adequate for sys-\ntemic flow and regional flows to relatively distal beds but that\naccurate measurements of CBF require LA injection of micro-\nspheres.\n\ncardiac output; regional blood flow; left-atrial catheterization\n\n \n\n \n\nSINCE ITS INTRODUCTION in 1967 by Rudolph ahd Hey-\nmann (13), the microsphere method has beeh extensively\nused because of its simplicity and the possibility of de-\ntermining regional as well as systemic blood flow even in\nsmall animals like rats (7-9, 11, 14). However, the accu-\nracy of results from microsphere injections depends fun-\ndamentailly on the uniform mixing of microspheres in the\nbloodstream; in that respect the site of injection may be\ncritical, particularly for coronary blood flow measure-\nments. Because of alleged difficulties of left-atrial cathe-\nterization, most studies of rats have utilized a left-ven-\ntricular approach, assuming in the process that mixing\nwas adequate (7, 9, 12, 14). However, experiments in dogs\nhave shown that left-ventricular injections give less de-\npendable results and more marked differences in the\ndistribution of microspheres to the heart than injections\ninto the left atrium (2, 5). Moreover our preliminary\nexperiments in rats did show a high variability of coro-\nnary blood flow measurements with left-ventricular in-\njections. We therefore developed a technique of left-atrial\ncatheterization in rats thet could be performed with no\nmajor technical difficulties. This allowed us to compare\nthe variability of blood flow detezminations made by left-\natrial injections with that of measurements obtained by\nleft-ventricle injection, as regards systemic (cardiac out-\n\nHee\n\nput) and regional (coronary, renal, cerebral) flows. The\nresults show that /) intra-atrial injections lead more\nconsistently to adequate dispersion of the microspheres\nin the aortic root than do intraventricular injections and\n2) the intra-atrial-injection technique must be preferred\nfor precise determinations of coronary blood flow because\nof the lower variability resulting from better mixing of\nthe microspheres.\n\nMETHODS\n\nExperiments were carried out in anesthetized rats sep-\narated into two groups. In group A (n = 10) the micro-\nspheres were injected first into the left atrium and sub-\nsequently into the left ventricle. In group B (n = 10) the\nleft-ventricular injection was performed first followed by\nthe intra-atrial injection. The sequence of studies was\nregularly alternated so that one animal of group A (left-\natrial injection first) was followed by one of group B\n(left-ventricular injection first).\n\nPreparation of rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were anes-\nthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg ip), and\nanesthesia was subsequently maintained with small doses\n(6-10 mg/kg ip) given as required approximately every\n30-45 min. The rats were intubated through the mouth\nand ventilated with room air. The same surgical sequence\nwas used in all animals whatever the order of injection.\n\nFirst, a catheter was positioned in the left atrium. The\nleft-atrial appendage was exposed by thoracotomy\nthrough the third left intercostal space, the pericardium\nwas opened, and a PE-10 tubing was advanced through\na small cut of the lateral wall of the appendage, secured\nin place, and passed through the chest wall along the\nsternum. The chest was closed after lung expansion by\npositive-intratracheal pressure while a negative pressure\nwas applied to the thoracic cavity. The animal was dis-\nconnected from the respirator, and the rest of the exper-\niment was performed while the rat was breathing spon-\ntaneously.\n\nTwo catheters (made up of a 3- to 4-cm-long Teflon\ntubing inserted into a PE-50 tubing) were then advanced\n3 and 3.6 cm in the aorta through a right- and left-\nfemoral-artery cannulation, respectively. The right-fem-\noral catheter was connected to a Micron MP-15 trans-\nducer for blood pressure recording. The left catheter was\nused to withdraw blood. A PE-10 tubing catheter was\nfinally inserted into \u201che right-carotid artery.\n\nIn group A the carotid catheter was advanced into the\nleft ventricle under blood pressure control after the lett-\n\n0363-6135/82 /0000-0000801.25 Copyright \u00a9 1982 the American Physiological Society",
